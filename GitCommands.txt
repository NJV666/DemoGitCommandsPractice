Important Points for both Git & Github:-
------------------------------------------

1)When ever we are creating a new repository from our github account it will generate a Git Repo URL.

Example:- https://github.com/NJV666/DemoGitCommandsPractice.git

2)After creating the repository we need to create any type of files.

3)When we make changes to files we need add and then stage them to commit.
	
	a)To add files to staging area we will use git add command.
	b)To commit files to local repository we will use git commit command.
	
Note:- We should provide the reason for commit message.

4)To publish local commits to central repository we will use git push command.

5)Whenever we commit git will generate commit-Id.
6)commit-Id contains 40 alphanumeric characters but from 40 alphanumeric characters it will 
  display only first 7 characters to us.
